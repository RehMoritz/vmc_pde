# vmc_pde

Solution of partial differential equations of probabilistic dynamics with normalizing flows.
We employ a time-dependent variational principle for probability distributions to reflect the changes of the distribution in the network parameters.

The code is localized in the folder "vmc_fluids" and the data and code that was used to generate plots is localized in "vmc_pde/vmc_fluids/paper_plot/".
